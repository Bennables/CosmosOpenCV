Hough Lines (huf lines)
y = mx = c
 input image --> input array of canny
 Resolution --> distance(1)  <-- 1, 2,3,4, ..  or distance(2) <-- 1,3,5,7
 revolution: angle(theta) pi/180
 threshold = upper threshold
 minimum line length = any line shorter than this will not be drawn
 max line gap - if the gap between lines is small, then they will merge, otherwise, they will stay the same.

Lines can be identified in images, but some images have many irrelevant lines.

what does the mask in bitwise_and do?
